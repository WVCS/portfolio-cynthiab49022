			This is a project called PROJECT STORE/BRAND that I did in Web Design around April 10, 2019, where the class had 
			to design an online shop for clothing attire. Since I designed the website myself, I had to often search up how to implement
			certain elements on Google, and I also often asked the teacher and fellow peers for help.<br>
			What was included: grid layout, Javascript, navigation bar.<br>
			(Disclaimer: All photos used in the website belong to the company Gucci. I do not own any of the pictures of clothing.
			These photos were used for non-profit, educational purposes.)

			This project is called FOOD/BEVERAGE SITE, which I completed in Web Design around February 14, 2019. 
			This website was also designed by myself. For this project, the prompt was to design a website for 
			a supposed food or beverage location.<br>
			What was included: Navigation bar, linking pages, text edits, color scheme. <br>
			(Disclaimer: I do not own any of the pictures of food.

			This project is called EVENT, which I completed for Web Design around March 18, 2019. The premise of 
			this project was to design a website for an important event that is to occur. 
			I chose to create a website for a pretend wedding, and included information that would be necessary for a real wedding.
			One difficult part about this project involved choosing fonts. There were many beautiful fonts that I found online, but many of them did not 
			work. In the end, I managed to find a nice looking and compatible font.
			What was included: Navigation bar, color scheme, font scheme, link opening a page in a new tab, cursor design.

			This project is called FINAL PROJECT, and is for a class called Computer Information Systems. This 
			website was part of a larger project, which included creating a logo, a Google Form and Slides, a word 
			document with all of our information, a website, and a Word application of some kind.
			What was used: Navigation bar, color scheme, box/grid layout.
