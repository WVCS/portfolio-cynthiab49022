		Cynthia is a sophomore in high school, and is currently taking a web design
		class that has taught her many skills useful to programming and designing websites.
		She hopes to one day become a programmer in an area that she is interested in, for 
		example, creating apps. Both of Cynthia's parents have jobs in the broad field of 
		computer science, and they got her interested in it too. Freshman year, she decided 
		to take AP Computer Science Principles to test the waters out, and found that she really
		liked the logical problem-solving theme of computer programming. Sophomore year, 
		she decided to take Web Design to learn how to create websites and Computer Information
		Systems to learn more about the computer's applications. Junior year, she plans on 
		taking Computer Science A/Data Structures in order to obtain more knowledge.
